# Medical Application using Microservices

## Purpose

## Activation

```
#create a virutal enviroment in the root folder

python3 -m venv venv

#activate it

source venv/bin/activate

#install uv 

pip install uv

#sync the dependencies

## What I did since forking

- added basic git files (LICENSE, gitignore)
- changed the package system from standard to UV (ultra-fast)
- removed pycache from public repo
